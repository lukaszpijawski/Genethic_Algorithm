# Genetic_Algorithm
Second project related to my AI classes. In this one I've implemented a genetic algorithm according to directions of my professor.

Here's only an implementation of N-Queens problem but using a kind of genetic algorithm. This project is also my first attempt to do unit tests.

Names of classes, functions etc. are in Polish because we started from an abstract class given by our professor which was in Polish and I followed this manner. Maybe I'll change it to English some day :)
